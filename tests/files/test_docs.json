At age 8, your child will likely have developed some interests and hobbies and will know what he or she likes or doesn't like. At the same time, children this age are learning more about the world at large and are also better able to navigate social relationships with others more independently, with less guidance from parents. At home, 8-year-olds are able to tackle more complicated household chores and take on more responsibility for taking care of themselves, even helping out with younger siblings. In general, according to the CDC, these are some changes you may see in your child: Shows more independence from parents and family. Starts to think about the future. Understands more about his or her place in the world. Pays more attention to friendships and teamwork. Wants to be liked and accepted by friends.1 Behavior and Daily Routines Fabrice Le Rouge/Getty Images The 8-year-old's behavior and daily routines are shaped by the child's taste, interests, and personality. Parents and other significant adults in the child's life should keep in mind the importance of being good role models since this is a time when children are figuring out the world and who they are and how they fit into it. At this age, your child may get involved with more complex social activities and behaviors that help define his or her sense of self. Effective discipline techniques at this age include continuing to praise good behavior, focusing your child's efforts, what they can do and change, rather than innate traits (such as \"you are smart\"). Set up and enforce consistent rules. Discipline should be aimed at guiding your child rather than punishing. Follow it with a discussion with your child about what she could do differently next time. Your 8-year-old can do more self-care in regards to hygiene and may begin to want to be part of deciding what the family eats. You might begin to give your child chores to contribute to the maintenance of the household and an allowance to begin to learn to manage money. At this age, your child still needs 10 to 11 hours of sleep per night.2 Physical Development Image Source/Getty Images For 8-year-old children, physical development will continue to be more about refinement of skills, coordination, and muscle control rather than huge changes. They begin to look like \"big kids,\" but puberty is still a couple of years away for most of them. Children with natural athletic potential may show their abilities at this developmental stage as their physical skills become more precise and accurate. In fact, this is often the age at which children decide whether they are athletic or not, and choose to participate in or avoid sports. Either way, it's important for parents to encourage physical activity. Even if your child isn't an athlete she can still enjoy running, swimming, biking, and many other types of non-sports-related physical fun.3 Emotional Development John Howard/Getty Images Eight-year-old emotional development may be growing at a deeper level than in younger years, and an 8-year-old may show more sophisticated and complex emotions and interactions. For instance, an 8-year-old may mask true thoughts or emotions to spare someone else's feelings or work through a problem without an adult's close supervision or intervention. This is the time when your child may be developing a more sophisticated sense of himself in the world. Her interests, talents, friends, and relationship with family all help her to establish a clear self-identity. It's also the beginning of desiring privacy and flip-flopping between self-confidence and self-doubt. It can be a good time to help your child develop patience and empathy for others.4 Cognitive Development Tom Merton/Getty Images Eight-year-old children are at a stage of intellectual development where they will be able to pay attention for longer periods of time. You can expect your child to be able to concentrate on an activity for up to an hour or more. Eight-year-olds will also be able to think more critically and express opinions using more complex and sophisticated vocabulary and language skills.5 Social Development Christopher Futcher/Getty Images This is the phase of social development where many children love being a part of sports teams and other social groups. In general, 8-year-old children enjoy school and will count on and value relationships with a few close friends and classmates. Parents of 8-year-olds should be on the lookout for problems such as school refusal, as this may indicate learning difficulties or being bullied at school. It is also a good age at which to discuss respecting others.6 What If My Child Is Different? Developmental milestones provide professionals and parents with a tool for comparing children to a norm. No child fits the ideal norm perfectly, and each child will have his or her personal quirks, strengths, challenges, and preferences. With that said, however, if you feel your child is far behind or ahead of the norm, it's well worth discussing the issue with your pediatrician and your child's teacher. If there are issues or opportunities, now is the time to learn about and address them. A Word From Verywell Your 8-year-old is in the full bloom of childhood. Enjoy activities and explore the world together. It's a great time to spark new interests in your child and watch her grow in every way. Sources: Anthony, Michelle.

Yes| No| I need help Ad Everything About Head Lice, Eggs, and Nits Even if you have excellent hygiene, ectoparasites such as lice, can strike. Most often, your child brings it home from school. If you become afflicted with such parasites, you must act quickly and make sure you are thorough in your efforts to get rid of them. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Lice are wingless and very tiny. They infest your scalp and other body areas such as the pubic and armpit regions. Adult lice lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, they leave shells behind. These shells are called nits. When you see these nits on your scalp or on any area of the body, it is a neon sign of a lice infestation. You should know how to check for lice nits if you want to have a parasite-free body and scalp. It will definitely make you more confident when mingling with other people. Yes, it may be tedious and laborious, but this will help ensure a healthier lifestyle. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help A Basic Description of Lice Recognize lice. You should definitely know how to recognize lice. These are wingless, tiny arthropods (six-legged invertebrates) that reside on your scalp. Lice are ectoparasites that rely on your blood to survive. They are about the size of a sesame seed. Lice are like mosquitoes, but instead of flying, they do best with crawling. You can get lice by being in direct contact with someone infested with head lice. Another way would be to share items such as headbands, clips, combs, or hats. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Eggs The female head lice lay eggs. These eggs are almost invisible to the naked eye because they're tiny and they blend into the color of your hair. Female head lice usually lay their eggs on the hair shafts near the hair roots. They attach with an adhesive that's naturally waterproof. That is why they cannot be blown or washed away. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help By the time the head lice eggs hatch, they leave empty eggshells behind. These are called nits. You could confuse nits with hairspray flakes, sand, or dandruff. Like the lice eggs, nits still have their adhesives so they cannot be removed that easily. Nits differ in coloration (brownish yellow, white). As the hair grows, the attached nits are found away from the roots. Since nits are indications of lice infestation, many schools do not admit children who have them. It is important for parents to check their children's heads for nits and eggs on a regular basis so that lice treatment could be performed immediately. Removing nits and lice eggs takes patience and a fine-toothed comb. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Life Cycle of Head Lice Head lice have three phases in their life cycle (40-50 days):1 Egg phase. The mature female lays eggs that are coated with an adhesive. This adhesive is effective for attaching the eggs to the hair shafts near the hair roots. The newly hatched head lice will hatch after 10 days. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Nymph phase. A nymph comes out of the head lice egg. They are not that easy to see. Nymphs cannot reproduce yet because they don't have a fully developed reproductive system yet. It takes 12 days for lice nymphs to mature. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Adult phase. This is the phase where the nymphs are finally mature enough to produce and lay eggs. Once they are sexually mature, they can lay four to 10 eggs every day. The life of adult head lice lasts about 28 days. Don't panic, but about 280 lice eggs could be laid by one mature female before she dies. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help How to Check for Head Lice, Nits, and Eggs You can tell if there is a head lice infestation when the suspected host itches all the time. Oftentimes, children scratch their heads, nape, or behind the ears. Red bumps or small wounds might also be present in these areas. Once you notice itching or bumps, immediately check your child's head. There could already be a head lice outbreak in their school. You can check for head lice, nits, and eggs by using the following steps: Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help First Check For Lice1 Choose a relaxing place. Select a comfortable area for head lice checking. You should position your child seated in front of you. This will allow you to check all over your child's head conveniently. Do not do this on furniture that's upholstered, as lice may end up there. Go for a kitchen chair instead...you might even want to do this on the back deck. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Make sure there is natural light. It should be bright enough so you could detect the nits. The tiny adult lice do move quickly so you have to have appropriate lighting to see them. Head lice eggs are translucent. Moving the light around or moving under the light helps pinpoint them. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Fully examine the scalp. Part areas of hair and look closely at the scalp, the area behind the ears, and the nape. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help The Wet Hair Technique Detecting head lice, eggs, and nits can be done by combing the hair with a fine-toothed comb. This method takes 5-15 minutes, depending on the thickness and the length of the hair. This can also be used as part of the treatment. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Wash the hair with regular shampoo. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Rinse the hair thoroughly and apply regular conditioner. Use three times the amount you usually use and do not rinse it out of the hair. This makes it really easy to comb. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Use a regular comb to remove tangles. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Get a fine-toothed comb or a detection comb. There are detection combs that come with or without prescriptions, available at any drug store. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Comb the hair using the detection comb. Make sure that it touches the scalp and reaches the tips of the hair. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Work the entire head. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Look at the comb and check for lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 If there are lice, nits, or eggs in the comb, wash it thoroughly first before running it through the hair again. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help9 Continue this process over the entire head. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help10 Rinse off the conditioner . Repeat the combing process to make sure every area is dealt with. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Dry Hair Technique This only takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on the hair's thickness. This is not effective for treating lice, only detecting it.1 Use an ordinary comb to untangle and straighten dry hair. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Use the detection comb as soon as the tangles are removed. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Start combing from the hair base to the hair tips. Do this about three to four times before combing the next area. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Examine the detection comb for lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 If there are any lice, nits or eggs in the comb, rinse the comb and dry it thoroughly before using it again. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Perform the process until every portion of the hair is cleared. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Symptoms of Pubic Lice Pubic lice can also be acquired. This is spread through sexual intercourse. If a sexual partner detects pubic lice infestation in his or her own pubic area, both sexual partners should be treated to avoid spreading the parasites again. Pubic lice are usually grey or brown. They can be acquired from infested clothes, bedding, and towels. Pubic lice look like tiny crabs and that's why they are also known as \"crabs\". These are the symptoms you have to watch out for: Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help1 Grey dots or brown dots present on the skin near or on the pubic area. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Intense level of itching. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 White eggs on the pubic hair shafts, very close to the roots. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 Pubic lice can also be present on the hair shafts of hair that grow on your underarms, trunk, and thighs. They could even be present in mustaches and beards. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Treatment of Pubic Lice1 Use special lice shampoos that are formulated to kill pubic lice. These shampoos work on dry pubic hair. Just be careful not to let the shampoo get in contact with mucus areas such as the anus or the vagina. The shampoo could burn or irritate the mucus areas. Leave the shampoo for on to 10 minutes. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help2 Pour on enough warm water to lather the shampoo up. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help3 Rinse the area thoroughly. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help4 If the patient has a hairy pubic area, a detection comb should be used to check for head lice, nits, and eggs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Rinse thoroughly. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Wash all clothes, sheets, undergarments, and towels using warm water for 20 minutes. This will ensure the death of the crabs. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 Perform another treatment after seven to 10 days of the first treatment to get rid of the newly hatched pubic lice. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help8 You might want to consider shaving the public hair to the skin, but don't do it anytime near the special shampoo. You really don't want that stuff absorbing into your skin. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help Symptoms of Body Lice Body lice move to your skin to feed and then return to the seams of your clothes. They lay their eggs in the seams. Home lice sprays can be used to kill the adult lice, nits, and eggs. Spray them on non-washable objects, vehicle interiors, furniture, and mattresses. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Treatment for Body Lice After ridding your body of lice, wash all linens, coats, scarves, hats (washable ones), towels, and garments using hot water. Use high heat in drying them for about 20 minutes. If the items are non-washable, have them dry-cleaned. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help Personal hygiene is important and checking for lice nits is a very significant part of it. Be vigilant in preventing this infestation so that you could have a lice-free, healthy lifestyle. Alternative Method For Removing Lice Without Harsh Chemicals This is an effective way to remove lice and nits from your child's hair, without the use of any dangerous chemicals. If you've got longer hair, tie it up while you're doing this process...just to be safer. Was this helpful? Yes| No| I need help What You'll Need Conditioner. Get a bottle or jar of thick conditioner - doesn't have to be expensive. Shampoo. Two towels. Four clips to hold hair out of your way. Plastic bag that will fit over the affected person's head. Fine-toothed comb. Blow dryer. Flat iron. This isn't a clothes iron, but like a curling iron, but flat. Girls use it to straighten their hair. Was this helpful?

Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help5 Smother them. Starting in the first section, from the nap of the neck, part the hair in \u00bd inch sections, putting a big dollop of conditioner at the roots. Make the next parting, more conditioner, and so on. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help6 Remove the clip each time you start a new section. Was this step helpful? Yes| No| I need help7 You'll actually see the critters crawling out of your way, and by the time you get to the front - where the bangs are, you'll see them all huddling. Was this step helpful?

Ali Haider/European Pressphoto Agency Burdened by debt and a devastating real estate crash, Dubai is doing what it does best: doubling down. Just one month after a close brush with bankruptcy, Dubai celebrated the opening of the world\u2019s tallest building on Monday \u2014 a rocket-shaped edifice that soars 2,717 feet and has views that reach 60 miles. The glittering celebration may have been an attempt by Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, to shift the focus from Dubai\u2019s current economic troubles to a future filled with more promise. All the same, the tower\u2019s success by no means signals a recovery in Dubai\u2019s beaten-down real estate market, where prices have collapsed by as much as 50 percent and many developers are having trouble finding occupants for their buildings. With its mix of nightclubs, mosques, luxury suites and boardrooms, the Burj is an almost perfect representation of Dubai\u2019s own complexities and contradictions. It will have the world\u2019s first Armani hotel; the world\u2019s highest swimming pool, on the 76th floor; the highest observation deck, on the 124th floor; and the highest mosque, on the 158th floor. Related Coverage The World\u2019s Tallest Building JAN. 4, 2010Fireworks Greet Tallest Skyscraper But in deciding to change the tower\u2019s name from Burj Dubai to Burj Khalifa, in honor of the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Dubai revealed a rare streak of humility consistent with its diminished economic condition. Once the most proudly autonomous of Arab Emirates, Dubai has found that its financial troubles have made it more dependent on Abu Dhabi and more likely to be drawn closer into the federation.\u201cDubai not only has the world\u2019s tallest building, but has also made what looks like the most expensive naming rights deal in history,\u201d said Jim Krane, the author of \u201cCity of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism.\u201d \u201cRenaming the Burj Dubai after Sheik Khalifa of Abu Dhabi \u2014 if not an explicit quid pro quo \u2014 is a down payment on Dubai\u2019s gratitude for its neighbor\u2019s $10 billion bailout last month.\u201dThe opening festivities had the feel of a national holiday, with fireworks, parachute jumps and shooting streams of water from the world\u2019s tallest fountain. At a cost estimated at $1.5 billion, the Burj took five years to build, is more than 160 floors high and has comfortably surpassed the previous record holder in Taiwan, the Taipei 101. More than 12,000 people will occupy its six million square feet, zooming up and down in 54 elevators that can reach speeds of 40 miles an hour. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in Chicago. At a time when several of Dubai\u2019s newly built office towers stand empty, it is 90 percent sold, according to the building\u2019s developer, Emaar Properties. To be sure, some have questioned the utility of such a towering project. At least three foreign workers died during the construction. And at a time of increasing concerns over global terrorism, such a building could pose an inviting target. The Burj Khalifa was named in honor of the president of Abu Dhabi. Charles Crowell/Bloomberg News But to Dubai, which from its very beginning has taken pleasure in proving its doubters wrong, the Burj is evidence that if you build it big and brash enough the people will come, from near and far. With its strong government backing and unquestioned prestige, the Burj was a project that was destined to succeed and its developer, Emaar, had little difficulty in attracting residents \u2014 particularly since much of the space was sold several years ago in the middle of Dubai\u2019s real estate frenzy. Other projects, however, have not been so lucky. One is the Omniyat Bayswater, a 24-story office building that stands less than half a mile from the Burj. It opened six months ago and remains more than 50 percent vacant.

Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. See Sample Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Aimed to be the flagship structure of an ambitious development project in an area by the sea called Business Bay, Omniyat Bayswater has been unable to attract tenants as a consequence of the current real estate crisis. But its struggle speaks to a larger truth behind the Dubai real estate bubble which, despite the excitement over the Burj, could well forestall a meaningful recovery. Like many office projects developed four or five years ago, the peak years of Dubai\u2019s expansion, the Omniyat Bayswater is plagued by splintered ownership. It is estimated to have more than 50 landlords \u2014 more than two per floor \u2014 with some trying to lease office suites as small as 1,000 square feet. A spokesman for Omniyat said that the developer recognized the problem of multiple owners, and had taken steps to address it and expected to see whole floors leased by the second quarter of this year. At a time when selling real estate was like handing out candy to children, the development model of selling to many owners, known as strata title, became a quick and easy way to finance building projects. Speculators from around the world were clamoring for the smallest slice of Dubai property. But with the crash, the building\u2019s ownership structure has made it extremely difficult to sell or lease a floor or two to foreign companies seeking to expand.\u201cThere has been a difficulty in creating a collective of owners,\u201d said Nick Maclean of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis in Dubai. \u201cThe majority of the building is empty.\u201dFew offers have been made for space in buildings under strata title, which is estimated to cover about two-thirds of the new buildings opening this year and 70 percent of those opening in 2011. Without government action, office vacancy rates could rise as high as 40 percent, according to real estate analysts. As for the effect the Burj will have on the overall market, Mr. Maclean said that its opening, while heartening, was unlikely to prompt an immediate turn around in the market.\u201cIt is a unique building and symbolically important but it is not going to stimulate demand,\u201d he said. Correction: January 7, 2010An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a $10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates.
